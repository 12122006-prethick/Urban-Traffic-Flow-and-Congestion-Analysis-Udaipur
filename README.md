🚦 Urban Traffic Flow and Congestion Analysis – Udaipur 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on preparing and organizing a real-world–style urban traffic dataset for data analysis and machine learning applications. The dataset represents traffic conditions across major locations in Udaipur city and includes attributes such as vehicle count, traffic density, weather conditions, and accident occurrence.

Urban traffic data is often complex and noisy. This project provides a clean, structured dataset that can be directly used for traffic pattern analysis, congestion studies, and smart city transportation research.
